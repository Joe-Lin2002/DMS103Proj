    Hi Welcome to my website!

    <h1>Project Intro</h1>
              <p>
              My project is focusing on the connection between human and nature. From capturing the human civilization and beauty of nature, there are some significant differences between two genres, which can create a sense of strong contrast, and also raise the environmental protection awareness among the viewers. 
              Taking picture of what I see in my life is my daily routine. I usually share some pictures on my social media, both sharing my happiness or some funny things that I met. There were some nature scenes posted on my social media. This is one of my great interest.
